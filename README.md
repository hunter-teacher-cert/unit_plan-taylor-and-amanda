# Post-AP Game Development Unit
by Taylor Grant-Knight and Wei (Amanda) Lee

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)

AP CS A after the AP Exam
Students will learn and understand how videogames are implemented 
They will explore the designs of childhood games and break down the core focus of the game
- visuals/aesthetics
- story (world-building)
- mechanics/game play
- technology (programming)
---

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)

We decided to make this unit because it fits with the Object-focused Java language
It challenges students and uses all the content learned from the year
Most students who are interested in Computer Science come from interests of video games.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation) 
- CRD-2.E - Develop a program using a development process.
- CRD-2.E.1 - A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature.
- CRD-2.E.2 - There are multiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: ● investigating and reflecting ● designing ● prototyping ● testing
- CRD-2.E.4 - A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.
- CRD-2.F - Design a program and its user interface.
- CRD-2.F.1 - The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.
- CRD-2.F.2 - Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.
- CRD-2.F.3 - Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows: ●        collecting data through surveys ●        user testing ●        interviews ●        direct observations
- CRD-2.F.4 - Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide.
- CRD-2.F.5 - A program’s specification defines the requirements for the program.
- CRD-2.F.6 - In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.
- CRD-2.F.7 - The design phase of a program may include: ●        brainstorming ●        planning and storyboarding ●        organizing the program into modules and functional components ●        creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface ●
