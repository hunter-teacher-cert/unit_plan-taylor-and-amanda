Main objective
  Students can define and identify game loops
  Use a while loop to simulate game play
  
Standards
  - 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
  - 9-12.CT.8: Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.
  - 9-12.CT.8: Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.
