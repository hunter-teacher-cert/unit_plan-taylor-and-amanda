Main objective
  Students will be able to 
    Understand the concept behind hitboxes
    Understand the concept behind collision
    Apply collision in their 2D game
    
Standards
  - 9-12.CT.4: Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.
  - 9-12.CT.8: Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

In class exercises
  Students need some tiles in the game to act as blocks for collision
  Set sprite solid (hit box) area
  Set up collisionChecker

Notes
  Need boolean to turn on and off collision
  Creating a hitbix within the sprite
  What happens to sprites after collision is detected?

Resources
  Code in src folder
  
Assignments
  Update their game so that the character sprite can detect collision
